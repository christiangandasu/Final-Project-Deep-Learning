# Deep Learning Based Recipe Suggestion with Image Recognition

A practical application using Sentence-Transformers for semantic search and Ultralytics YOLO for ingredient detection, allowing users to find recipes they can cook immediately based on available ingredients.


## 1. Live Application

The application is deployed and accessible here:

**https://huggingface.co/spaces/gandasu/Deep-Learning-Final-Project**

## 2. Key Features

The system provides recipe ranking based on a Balanced-Focus approach:

* Intelligent Search: Combines manual text input and image-detected ingredients.
* Ranking Formula: Prioritizes both conceptual relevance.

$$\text{Final Score} = 0.5 \times \text{Semantic Similarity} + 0.5 \times \text{Ingredient Overlap}$$

| Component | Technology | Core Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic Search** | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (Sentence-Transformers) | Generates 384-dim embeddings to measure conceptual relevance. |
| **Object Detection** | `ultralytics` (YOLO) | Real-time ingredient recognition using the custom model (`best.pt`). |
| **Preprocessing** | `spaCy` (`en-core-web-sm`) | Standardizes input ingredients via lemmatization. |

## 3. Repository Structure

| File / Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`app.py`** | Main application file. |
| **`requirements.txt`** | Complete dependency list. |
| **`best.pt`** | YOLO model file. |
| **`recipes_final_with_images.parquet`** | Main recipe metadata dataset. |
| **`recipe_embeddings.npy`** | Pre-calculated embeddings for the recipe database. |
| **`HYBRID.ipynb` / `main.ipynb`** | Development and exploratory notebooks. |
